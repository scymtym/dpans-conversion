* Introduction

  This module is responsible for parsing the dpANS TeX sources as well
  as the somewhat structured plain text sources of the X3J13 cleanup
  issues into abstract syntax trees. The code performs those two
  parsing tasks by employing two special-purpose parsers:

  + The dpANS TeX sources are parsed using a combination of an
    incomplete parser for general TeX syntax and specialized parsing
    rules for semantic markup used in the dpANS TeX sources.

  + The X3J13 cleanup issues are parsed using a specialized parsers
    for the loosely described plain text-based format the issue files
    are supposed to conform to (which, to be fair, they mostly do).
